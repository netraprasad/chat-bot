# Facebook Bot

Haha! This is a fun project.

## Installation

*I assume you are linux user and have python installed.*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/geekyarthurs/chat-bot.git
cd chat-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Make a file named .env inside chat-bot folder and save username and password like this.

```bash
USERNAME=yourfbusername
PASSWORD=yourpassword
```



## Using the bot.

### main.py will automatically reply to texts using random texts from list inside messages.py list. you can change that file if you want to.
```
python main.py
```

- Just a quick tip, you need to tell -s- to start the bot in inbox and -x- will stop the bot from replying.

### reactor.py will send meme, jokes and use google tts to translate your text to speech.

```
python reactor.py
```

Feel free to contribute. <3
